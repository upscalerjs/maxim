# UpscalerJS implementation of Maxim

This repository contains code associated with download and converting the [Maxim models](https://github.com/google-research/maxim) into Tensorflow.js-compatible models.

The models are intended for use with [UpscalerJS](http://github.com/thekevinscott/UpscalerJS/).
