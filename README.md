# UpscalerJS implementation of Maxim

This repository contains code associated with download and converting the [Maxim models](https://github.com/google-research/maxim) into Tensorflow.js-compatible models.

There are two notebooks:

- [Instructions on how to port the original Jax models](Runbook - Jax Models.ipynb).
- [Instructions on how to port the alternative Tensorflow models](Runbook - TF Models.ipynb).

The models are intended for use with [UpscalerJS](http://github.com/thekevinscott/UpscalerJS/).

[See the Runbook for instructions on how to port models](Runbook.ipynb).
